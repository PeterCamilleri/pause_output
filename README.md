# PauseOutput

The pause_output gem provides a facility like the classic more (or less) utility
within Ruby programs. This little bit of code started out as a feature of the
mysh (my shell) program but was spun off as it was felt that this capability
had use on a larger scale.

Also included is a simple demo program called pom (Pause Output More) This
simple demo accepts a list of files and displays them, pausing as needed.
It is as easy to use as this:

    pom README.md

## Installation
